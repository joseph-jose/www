<field dated="2-Sep-2023" description="HelloEveryone,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good evening everyone. NSMA expresses heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has come forward and registered to celebrate Onam 2023 with us on 8th and 9th of September 2023, at Milford school, Auckland. We are proud to have such a dynamic group of people in our community. Registrations have reached more than expected numbers  and we are filling up faster than expected. Hence the committee has come to a unanimous decision of holding off any further registrations, until there is confirmation that we can take in more. So as per this decision the registrations for Onam 2023 will be withdrawn/stopped from 0900 am tomorrow 3/9/23.&lt;br/&gt;Once again we apologize for this abrupt decision made and hope that we have nt disappointed anyone. There will be no more ticket sales from tomorrow. This is a necessary step and is being taken so that the program is carried on smoothly. Those who still wish to participate please make use of this time window and register as soon as possible. Thank you again and Happy Onam.&lt;br/&gt;Kind regards&lt;br/&gt;Team NSMA"/>

As you will have seen in the media, the Newzealand Prime Minister has announced a range of measures to protect New Zealanders from COVID-19. After midnight Sunday 15 March all people entering NZ from anywhere overseas (with the exception of a small number of Pacific Island nations) will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.This is a significant step undertaken by the Newzealand Government to reduce and slow the transmission of COVID-19 in our community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 
If you are planning on going overseas in the near future, strongly encourage you to check the Government’s Safe Travel website ( https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/)which advises New Zealanders to avoid all non-essential travel overseas. If you must still travel, the government will require you to self-isolate for 14 days upon returning to NZ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
Kind regards&lt;br/&gt;
