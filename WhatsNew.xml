As you will have seen in the media, the Newzealand Prime Minister has announced a range of measures to protect New Zealanders from COVID-19. After midnight Sunday 15 March all people entering NZ from anywhere overseas (with the exception of a small number of Pacific Island nations) will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.This is a significant step undertaken by the Newzealand Government to reduce and slow the transmission of COVID-19 in our community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 
If you are planning on going overseas in the near future, strongly encourage you to check the Government’s Safe Travel website ( https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/)which advises New Zealanders to avoid all non-essential travel overseas. If you must still travel, the government will require you to self-isolate for 14 days upon returning to NZ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
